## What is this App All About

ScrambledWords is a fun and interactive word puzzle game built with SwiftUI! Unscramble the letters to guess the correct word based on an image clue. Perfect for learning, practicing spelling, or just challenging yourself.

  â€¢ Image-Based Clues: Each puzzle displays an image as a hint for the word to unscramble.

  â€¢ Tap & Arrange Gameplay: Tap on scrambled letters to form your guess.

  â€¢ Instant Feedback: Get immediate feedback on your answers.

  â€¢ Score Tracking: Your score is displayed at the end of the game.

  â€¢ Replayable: Play with a new set of questions each time.

## What I have learned

â€¢ SwiftUI State Management: Used @State properties to manage the game state, including guessed letters, score, and UI updates.

â€¢ Dynamic UI Updates: Updated the interface reactively as the game progresses.

â€¢ User Interaction: Implemented tap gestures for letter selection and answer submission.

â€¢ Data Modeling: Utilized structs to represent letters and questions, and managed game logic cleanly.

â€¢ Feedback & Alerts: Provided visual feedback for correct and incorrect answers, as well as a final score summary.
